  <!-- cards on cards on cards; 
      each card is partial form, flippable,  
      view looks like a list of cards.
      
      You can copy the design from flashcards.html or quizzes.html
      And where the text labels would be, have edittable text fields instead
      Similar to powerpoint. The next and prev areas can be used here too
