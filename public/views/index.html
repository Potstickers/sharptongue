                    Using the power of Google's translate 
                    subdomain we have created a website that
                    allows users to learn from 
                    simple images and words. The same way you
                    did as a kid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can create your own lessons
                    which can help you review words with images
                    are most interested in. These lessons
                    become available to other users which can
                    be upvoted or downvoted.
