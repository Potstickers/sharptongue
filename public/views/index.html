            Using the power of Google's translate 
            subdomain we have created a website that
            allows users to learn from 
            simple images and words. The same way you
            did as a kid. 
        </p>
        <p>
            You can create your own lessons
            which can help you review words with images
            are most interested in. These lessons
            become available to other users which can
            be upvoted or downvoted.
